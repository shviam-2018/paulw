    <h1>Founder of <span>Raccoon Press</span></h1>
    <br>
    <p>Paul Wennersberg-LÃ¸vholen is the creative force behind Raccoon Press (formerly known as Paul's Books), where he crafts captivating tales for children that have garnered widespread acclaim. Among his standout works is the beloved children's book Super Farty Pants, which has captured the hearts of young readers everywhere, selling over 10,000 copies since its release in 2019. In addition to this cherished title, Paul has penned several other delightful children's books.
        <br>
        Before embarking on his children's literature journey, Paul honed his creative skills in filmmaking, producing and directing a number of horror films. However, his life took an unexpected turn when he became a father, inspiring him to create stories for children.
        <br>
        Originally hailing from Wales, Paul now calls Norway home, where he balances his time between teaching at a college, spending time with his family, and skiing down snow-capped mountains. More recently, Paul has expanded his creative endeavors by offering editing, formatting, and self-publishing services to fellow authors, guiding them through the often confusing world of independent publishing.</p>
