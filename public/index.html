            Raccoon Press (originally Paul's Books) was established in 2019, with the publication of my first
            children's book—<em>Super Farty Pants!</em> which I initially wrote for my own children.
        </p>
        <p>
            I read them a lot of books, and whilst the book market is flooded, I was struggling to find ones that were actually good—so I took it upon myself to write my own. I hadn't planned on publishing it but was given a few gentle nudges from close friends who had enjoyed it. That book has now sold over 10,000 copies worldwide. That was just the start of my journey and since then I have published several other titles, alongside helping other authors bring their creations to life.

            RL Stine (author of <em>Goosebumps</em>) once said, "Many adults feel that every children's book has to teach them something.... My theory is a children's book... can be just for fun."
        </p>
        <p>
          <br>
            My mission is to create books that are not only engaging and fun to read, but with substance.
