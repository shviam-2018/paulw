      <p class="hero-description">About Raccoon Press <br>
        Raccoon Press (originally Paul's Books) was established in 2019,  with the publication of my first<br>
        children's book- Super Farty Pants! which I initially wrote for my own children. <br>  
        I read them a lot of books, and whilst the book market is flooded, I was struggling to find ones that <br>
        were actually good- so I took it upon myself <br> to write my own. I hadn't planned on publishing it <br>
        but was given a few gentle nudges from close friends <br> who had enjoyed it. That book has now sold over 10,000 copies <br>
        worldwide. That was just the start of my journey and since then I have published several other titles, <br>
        alongside helping other authors bring their creations to life. <br>
    
        RL Stine (author of Goosebumps) once said "Many adults feel that every children's book has to teach <br> 
        them something.... My theory is a children's book... can be just for fun." <br>
    
        My mission is to create books that are not only engaging and fun to read, but with substance.
